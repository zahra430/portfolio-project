      <p class="project-description">
        In the furniture design project, I worked on the issue of inefficiency
        of Isfahan municipal employees. After conducting several interviews with
        the employees of this organization, I realized that social interactions
        can highly affect their efficiency at work. So the solution I offered
        was to design a mini coffee shop (Orsey) to benefit from the employees'
        break times for enhancing their interaction and vitality. The form of
        this coffee shop was inspired by Iranian motifs due to the
        cultural-historical background of the city. That was when I became
        interested in social design and its influence on people's behavior.

      <p class="project-description mb-4">
        In the environmental design project, I focused on designing a vase made
        with natural materials such as animal silk, and pistachio and almond
        shells. Along with this project, I also worked on redesigning the
        Charbagh pedestrian route in Isfahan City to improve climatic comfort
        and social interaction, which was very effective in getting familiar
        with my research interest in sustainable design.

      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Contact with Industry Project</h2>
      <p class="project-description mb-4">
        I worked on the problems of elderly patients in the Contact with
        Industry project. After publishing the online questionnaire, the
        existence of problems such as low medical knowledge, forgetting doctor
        appointments, and time of taking medicine were revealed and patients'
        interest in nostalgic issues also was noticeable. The solution I
        proposed was a home health hub that would intelligently remind the
        family members when to take pills and make an appointment with the
        doctor after receiving their medical records. This product also could
        play music and make phone calls. The form of this concept was inspired
        by telephones that had become nostalgic products. During this project, I
        realized the importance of the way users interact with a machine, so I
        got familiar with the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) concept and its
        effects on a healthy lifestyle.

      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Packaging</h2>
      <p class="project-description mb-4">
        One of the largest waste-producing industries is the packaging industry.
        The neglect of these industries regarding the sustainability approach
        has caused many ecosystem problems. In this project, I was looking for
        added value to the packaging through Iranian crafts to increase its life
        cycle. For this purpose, I designed a concept of cretonne fabric and
        marquetery plate, which are handicrafts of Isfahan city, with
        paperboard, for packing stools. The symbols used in the packaging
        graphics have cultural values that carry added value along with the
        handicrafts used. This packaging can be made in different dimensions.
        The concept was also submitted to a packaging design competition and was
        admired by the jury committee.

      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Dialux Project</h2>
      <p class="project-description mb-4">
        In the final project of Physics III (Electricity & Light), I designed
        suitable home lighting for both party and work modes using Dialux
        software. This project gave me a good understanding of interior lighting
        design and learning about Dialux software capabilities was very
        effective in the quality of my other projects.
